My attempts at solutions to advent of code 2023. You can run each solution by changing into the `src` directory and
running the python file for each day using `python <num>.py` or `pypy3 <num>.py`.

Day 19 requires numpy.

Here is a summary of the outputs produced together with the runtime (using Measure-Command on Windows):
